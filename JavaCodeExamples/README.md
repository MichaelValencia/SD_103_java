# JavaCode
This project contains tons of examples for the Java class
 Most of the names of the files are kind of helpful to indicate what they cover
 Some of them use a simple menuing system to keep asking for a menu option so you can keep testing the same concept over and over without having to restart the application constantly for the next test
